# Project README

## Overview
This C project contains a collection of tasks that focus on basic programming concepts such as random number generation, string manipulation, and loops. Below is a concise description of each task along with the respective file names.

### Tasks and File Descriptions

1. **Positive Anything is Better Than Negative Nothing**  
   **Filename:** `positive_anything.c`  
   Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive or negative.

2. **The Last Digit**  
   **Filename:** `last_digit.c`  
   Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

3. **I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia**  
   **Filename:** `alphabet_game.c`  
   Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line.

4. **alphABET**  
   **Filename:** `alphabet_upper.c`  
   Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, and then a new line.

5. **When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup**

   Description: Similar to `alphabet_game.c`, this program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line.

6. **Numbers**  
   **Filename:** `single_digit_numbers.c`  
   Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7. **Numberz**  
   **Filename:** `numberz.c`  
   Description: This program also prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. (Note: This task may duplicate the functionality of the previous task.)

8. **Smile in the Mirror**  
   **Filename:** `reverse_alphabet.c`  
   Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line.

9. **Hexadecimal**
