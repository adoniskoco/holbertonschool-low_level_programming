## Task 0: Print a Name
- **Filename:** `0-print_name.c`
- **Description:** This task involves writing a function that prints a name to the standard output. The function takes a string (name) as an argument and outputs it.
  
## Task 1: Array Iterator
- **Filename:** `1-array_iterator.c`
- **Description:** In this task, you are required to write a function that accepts an array and a function pointer. The function should iterate over the array and apply the function passed as a parameter to each element of the array.
  
## Task 2: Integer Search
- **Filename:** `2-int_index.c`
- **Description:** Write a function that searches for an integer within an array. The function should take an array, its size, and a target integer as input. It returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if the integer is not present in the array.

## Task 3: Simple Calculator
- **Files:**
  - `3-main.c`
  - `3-op_functions.c`
  - `3-get_op_func.c`
  - `3-calc.h`
- **Description:** This task involves writing a program that performs simple arithmetic operations. The program should:
  - Accept two integers and an operator as input.
  - Perform the operation based on the operator.
  - Support the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - The `main.c` file contains the entry point of the program. 
  - The `op_functions.c` file defines functions for each of the arithmetic operations.
  - The `get_op_func.c` file returns the appropriate function pointer based on the input operator.
  - The `calc.h` file contains the necessary function prototypes and macros.
