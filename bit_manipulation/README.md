## Tasks

1. **Convert a Binary Number to an Unsigned Integer**
   - **Filename:** `0-binary_to_uint.c`
   - **Description:** This task requires writing a function that converts a binary number (represented as a string) to an unsigned integer.

2. **Print the Binary Representation of a Number**
   - **Filename:** `1-print_binary.c`
   - **Description:** This task involves writing a function that prints the binary representation of a given integer.

3. **Get the Value of a Bit at a Given Index**
   - **Filename:** `2-get_bit.c`
   - **Description:** The function implemented here returns the value of a bit (either 0 or 1) at a specific index in a given integer.

4. **Set the Value of a Bit to 1 at a Given Index**
   - **Filename:** `3-set_bit.c`
   - **Description:** This task requires writing a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a specified index in a given integer.

5. **Set the Value of a Bit to 0 at a Given Index**
   - **Filename:** `4-clear_bit.c`
   - **Description:** The function in this file sets the value of a bit to 0 at a specific index in a given integer.

6. **Count the Number of Bits to Flip to Change One Number to Another**
   - **Filename:** `5-flip_bits.c`
   - **Description:** This task involves writing a function that calculates the number of bits you need to flip in order to change one number into another.
