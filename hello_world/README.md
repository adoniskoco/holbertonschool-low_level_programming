# C Project README

Welcome to the C Project! This repository contains several tasks designed to enhance your understanding of C programming, compilation, and basic scripting. Below is a concise description of each task, along with the corresponding file names.

## Tasks Overview

### 0-preprocessor
**File:** `0-preprocessor`  
**Description:** This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. It demonstrates the preprocessing step in the compilation process.

### 1-compiler
**File:** `1-compiler`  
**Description:** This script compiles a C file but does not link it. It showcases how to generate an object file from a C source file.

### 2-assembler
**File:** `2-assembler`  
**Description:** This script generates the assembly code of a C program and saves it in an output file. It illustrates the translation from high-level code to assembly language.

### Name
**File:** `Name`  
**Description:** This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. It focuses on compiling and linking to produce an executable.

### Hello, puts
**File:** `Hello, puts`  
**Description:** This C program prints the following text:  
`"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`  
followed by a new line. It highlights the use of the `puts` function for output.

### Hello, printf
**File:** `Hello, printf`  
**Description:** This C program prints the following text:  
`"with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,"`  
followed by a new line. It demonstrates the use of the `printf` function for formatted output.

### Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
**File:** `Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation`  
**Description:** This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. It helps in understanding data type sizes in C.

## Conclusion

Feel free to explore each task and their implementations. This project is a great way to practice C programming concepts and scripting for compilation processes. Happy coding!
